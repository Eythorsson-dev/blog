title:  New Job - What i have learned after 1 year
---

Almost one year ago, i changed jobs. A decition that did not come lighly (out of respect from all the things i had learned at my previous employer). After deciding that it was time to look for other oppertunities, i eventually found my current employer. It has now almost been one year since i started, and here are all the things that i have learned so far


- The importance of collaboration and thinking twise before implementation, espesically in complex business senarios
  - By thinking twise, thrise and even four times before implementing, you can reduce the risk of wasting time on a solution that will be too time consuming, and not worth while (yet). At our job, we have a tendancy to implement the perfect solution - which has lead to us not having been able to close a single sprint since we started. 
- Sometimes what you think is done, is not actually done
- In a Minimum Viable Product (MVP), is the key word Minimal. A MVP, should be closer to a POC than an actual finished product
- AWS, Serverless, and Event driven development
  - I have really come to love the idea of
- Abstraction and Test Driven Development
  - We have attempted to do TDD, however it has not quite worked out for us. I believe this is because the way we perform our planning. When we plan the issues to be done, we leave a lot of freedom and responsability on the developer implementing the solution. Leading to a lot of experimentation and exploration when developing.
- By writing strickter exception free code, you can prevent errors by forcing the developer to deal with error conditions.
  - Use ValueObjects, Domain Models etc.


These are the points that are on the top of my mind
